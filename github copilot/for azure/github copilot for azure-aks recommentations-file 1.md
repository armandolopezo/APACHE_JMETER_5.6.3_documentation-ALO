armandolopezo: @azure do you have any samples or templates I can use to get started for testing aks with horizontal pod autoscaler?

Azure (Preview): You can use the [Azure Kubernetes Service Store Demo](https://github.com/azure-samples/aks-store-demo) template to get started with testing AKS and implementing the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. This template showcases a microservices architecture running on AKS, which can be adapted to include Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for dynamic scaling based on workload.

### Steps to Get Started:

1. **Install the Azure Developer CLI**:
   ```bash
   winget install microsoft.azd
   ```
   You may need to restart your IDE. More details on installing the Azure Developer CLI can be found [here](https://aka.ms/install-azd).

2. **Initialize the Template**:
   ```bash
   azd init --template https://github.com/azure-samples/aks-store-demo
   ```

This template also demonstrates integration with various Azure services and deployment options, making it a comprehensive starting point for AKS-based applications.

Azure (Preview): To install the Azure Developer CLI (azd) on your Windows system, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
winget install microsoft.azd
```

If you encounter any issues, make sure that the Windows Package Manager (winget) is installed and updated on your system. After installation, you may need to restart your terminal or IDE for the changes to take effect.

armandolopezo: @azure Do i need azure cli to install azd?

Azure (Preview): No, you do not need the Azure CLI to install the Azure Developer CLI (azd). You can install azd independently using the Windows Package Manager (winget) with the command `winget install microsoft.azd`.

armandolopezo: @azure What are the prerequisites for installing azd?

Azure (Preview): The prerequisites for installing the Azure Developer CLI (azd) are:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Package Manager**: 
  - For Windows: Windows Package Manager (winget).
  - For macOS: Homebrew.
  - For Linux: You can use the installation script provided by Microsoft.
- **.NET SDK**: Ensure that the .NET SDK is installed, as azd may require it for certain operations.
- **Node.js**: Some templates may require Node.js, so it's recommended to have it installed.

Make sure your system meets these requirements before installing azd.

   - Visit the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS (Long Term Support) version installer for Windows.

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - Execute the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Ensure that you check the option to add Node.js to your PATH during installation.
